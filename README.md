# Movie-Search-OMDB
*Build a movie search website with the OMDb API using Javascript,HTML,CSS,Json,Ajax.

*Given basic HTML/CSS, program the search form to return movie data in JSON format based on the form submission.
* Use the API data to dynamically create HTML displaying a movie's title, year of release, and poster image.
* Display a placeholder icon when the API does not return poster data.
* Let users know when search returns no movie data.
* For extra credit, link a movie to its IMDb page when you click on the poster, and allow a user to filter the search by year of release.
